# Monster Monitor Plugin

## Overview

The **Monster Monitor** plugin is a RuneLite plugin designed to help players track their NPC kills and set specific kill limits. This plugin is especially useful for those who want to monitor their progress while farming NPCs or working towards specific goals, such as boss kill milestones or grinding for drops.

## Features

- **Kill Tracking**: Automatically tracks the number of kills for each NPC you engage with and logs the information for future reference.
- **Set Kill Limits**: Allows you to set a kill limit for specific NPCs and notifies you when the limit is reached. You can customize the limit directly through the plugin's panel.
- **Notifications**: Receive in-game notifications when you've reached your kill limit for an NPC. Notifications can be customized or disabled through the plugin's configuration.
- **Dynamic Overlay**: Displays the NPCs you're currently tracking along with their respective kill counts and limits in a customizable overlay.
- **Reset Options**: Easily reset kill counts or remove an NPC from tracking via the plugin panelâ€™s context menu.
